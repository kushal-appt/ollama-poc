Sure, I'd be happy to help you set up your TypeScript project! Here are the steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your TypeScript project.

2. Install TypeScript using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in the terminal/command prompt:

   ```bash
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   ```

3. Open a new file in your preferred text editor and create a new TypeScript file with the `.ts` extension, such as `index.ts`.

4. In the new file, add some code to initialize your project by importing the necessary modules:

   ```typescript
   import * as path from 'path';
   import * as fs from 'fs';
   ```

5. Create a TypeScript file with the `.ts` extension and import the `app` module, which contains the main function for your project:

   ```typescript
   import * as app from './app';
   
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`App running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

6. Create a TypeScript file with the `.js` extension and export your main function:

   ```typescript
   export default function main() {
     return app;
   }
   ```

7. Run your project by running `node index.ts` in the terminal/command prompt. This will start your TypeScript project and open a browser window with your application.

That's it! You have successfully set up your TypeScript project.
